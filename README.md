Udacity

In this repository are notes, assignments, and programming modules from the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

* Allstate: My capstone project for the Nanodegree in which I minimzed the MAE of claims recieved by Allstate using XGBoost, custom objective functions, and statistical transformations.
* boston-housing: Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
* creating-customer-segments: Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.
* smartcab: Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.
* student_intervention: Investigated the factors that affect a student's performance in high school. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on a given dataset to predict how likely a student is to pass. Selected the best model based on relative accuracy and efficiency.
* titanic_survival_exploration: Explored data around titanic survival rates, creating a simple decision tree on the categorical variables present in the data.
* Notes: notes that I have taken during the course of the Nanodegree.
